# Oembed-react

oEmbed is a format for allowing an embedded representation of a URL on third party sites. 
The simple API allows a website to display embedded content (such as photos or videos) when a user posts a link to that resource, 
without having to parse the resource directly.

## Installation
     npm install
     npm start
     webpack --watch
